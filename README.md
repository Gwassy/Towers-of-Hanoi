# Towers-of-Hanoi

A Java GUI application that will simulate the towers of Hanoi game.

It will have two modes: a manual one, in which the user tries to finish the game and an automatic one, in which the game will
be finished by the computer.
  
The user should be able to specify the number of disks.

The user should be able to abandon the game.

There should be a timer that monitors the period to complete the game.

The automatic mode should run on a separate thread, so that the application doesn't freeze.
